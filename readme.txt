about how to train:

G Hinton
Reducing the Dimensionality of
Data with Neural Networks

autoencoder

there is training problem:
With large initial weights,
autoencoders typically find poor local minima;
with small initial weights, the gradients in the
early layers are tiny, making it infeasible to
train autoencoders with many hidden layers.
